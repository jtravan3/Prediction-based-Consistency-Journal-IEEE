\subsection{Category Selection}
Concurrent transactions that are submitted to the scheduler are graphed on the Transaction Categorization Graph (see Figure \ref{graph:cat_graph}) which will therefore place the transaction into one of the four categories based on the metadata stored about the transaction. The set of transactions that are submitted to the scheduler will be composed within one or many serializable schedules depending on the transactions categories. Any transaction that is contained within a conflicting category (see Definition \ref{conflict_cat}) will be the sole transaction within a serializable schedule. This is a key component of the prediction-based solution that ensures consistency among known transactions. By allowing a misbehaving transaction to execute solely without the interleaving of other transactions, this prevents cascading rollbacks and inconsistent states within the database. Any transactions that are not contained within a conflicting category will be scheduled within a separate serializable schedule that contains other transactions of non-conflicting categories. This separation of conflicting and non-conflicting transactions allows for concurrent execution of transactions but with the reduction of cascading rollbacks and the increase in consistency. The next section outlines the formal analysis of the solution presented.
