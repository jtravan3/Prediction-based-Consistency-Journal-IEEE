In order to make the composite service adapt to such dynamic property of Web services, we propose a self-healing approach for web service composition. Such an approach is an integration of backing up in selection and reselecting in execution. In order to make the composite service heal itself as quickly as possible and minimize the number of reselections, a way of performance prediction is proposed in this paper. On this basis, the self-healing approach is presented including framework, the triggering algorithm of the reselection and the reliability model of the service. Experiments show that the proposed solutions have better performance in supporting the self-healing Web service composition.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of providing long-running web service transactions that maintain consistency, high availability, and durability. Long running transactions involve human interaction as activities in the transaction. The human interaction increases the latency of the overall transaction. Implementation options are considered for managing limited resources held by a transaction that contain two or more web service requests separated by human interaction. In our previous work, we proposed a replica update propagation method called the Buddy System, which guaranteed consistency, durability and higher availability of web services. The previous work studied transactions composed of a single coarse-grained request. In this paper, the Buddy System is extended to allow long-running transactions comprising two or more web-service calls separated by human interaction.},

	abstract = {Electronic business processing has drastically grown since the advent of the World Wide Web. As transaction processing is at the heart of business processing, many companies have been interested in transaction processing on the Web. However, little attention has been paid to supporting consistent transaction processing on the Web, while most works have focused on performance enhancement, processing multiple HTTP requests in a single context, and scalability. This paper identifies three consistency problems in processing transactions on the Web and proposes solutions for each problem. These are based on cookie logging, Web page logging, and storing information for unilaterally aborted transactions. Some of the proposed ideas have been implemented in a Web transaction processing system, WebTP. We believe that they can be also applied to any other Web transaction processing system of similar architecture.},

	abstract = {Building mission critical applications and services (e.g. e-commerce) using process-oriented approaches has had successes and difficulties. These applications automated successfully the important frequent cases such as purchases, but the code needed for handling exceptions such as cancellations and failures tend to grow to disproportionate size and complexity. These difficulties lead to non-automated and expensive solutions such as call centers, which resolve data inconsistency problems manually. In this paper we describe the WED-flow (work, event, and data-flow) approach, which provides transactional recovery through incremental evolution of exception handling, by combining the concepts of advanced transaction models, events, and data states. By carefully recording the detailed data states of each execution step, WED-flow composes backward and forward recovery mechanisms as reusable exception handling services to preserve the consistency of all databases involved in the application with well-defined correctness properties. A practical application of the automated recovery in WED-flow is the real-time recovery of failed cases for mission-critical applications and services.},
